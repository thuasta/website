# Build Systems

A build system is a collection of tools and utilities that automate the process of compiling, linking, and executing source code files in a project. The primary goal of build systems is to manage the complexity of the compilation process and produce a build (executable or binary files) in the end. In C++ (cpp), some common build systems are GNU Make, CMake, xmake, Autotools, SCons, and Ninja.
