# Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. It is often used for writing on the web, so you don't have to write cumbersome HTML tags. The main goal of learning Markdown is to focus on your content without being distracted by complex formatting and to make your content more readable and easier to maintain.
